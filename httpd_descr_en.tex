\subsection{Hostname Description}

The DNS name of the system is set with the host name. Normally,
the the host name can be set in a text file. The hostname service
can set this host name for the system. It will override any previosly set
name. After a new host name is set the hostname service needs to be reloaded
to make the host name effective.
