\subsection{Database Service Description}

The database is used to save relational data. That data can be the data of a web site, email accounts or other data. Relational databases are MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL and other. Normally only one database service is installed on a system and is used by other services to store and lookup data.

The database service can install the database, configure the administrator password, create databases and users. Furthermore, it can import and execute database scripts to setup tables and data. Full user or database management is not in the scope of the database service, for example it is not possible to remove users or delete databases. For a full user or database management a database management client like phpMyAdmin should be installed.
