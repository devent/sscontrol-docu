\subsection{Hosts Description}

The hosts file is a list of IP addresses and their host names, with optional
aliases. This list is used to loop up which host name belongs to what 
IP address and wise versa. The hosts service can add new entries or change
old entries in the hosts file. The profile can be set to include a default
list of entries to be included.

An entry is identified by the IP address. If the same IP address is found
in the hosts file then the entry is updated with the host name and aliases
specified in the script file. If the IP address is not found then the 
entry is a new entry and will be added in the hosts file. Unknown host entries
are not modified by the script.

The hosts file normally contains a default set of entries, which are the local
host in the local domain. Such default hosts can be set as a profile property
and can be customized to the server type.
